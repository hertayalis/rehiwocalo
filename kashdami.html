The opening lines express a shoutout to a friend, Dyc, while the subsequent lines delve into themes of drug use, violence, and deception. The reference to "lean" and getting "Tylenol" suggests that someone was looking for a specific substance but ended up with a counterfeit or ineffective replacement. The line "Lil' shawty ugly, we fuck with the lights off" indicates a casual sexual encounter and a preference for anonymity. The mention of a "white plug" serving drugs while wearing overalls adds a sense of nonchalant or unconventional dealing. The lyrics further assert a readiness to defend oneself against any threats, with the reference to spraying someone like Lysol if they try to run up on the singer. The lyrics also touch on the idea of people being dishonest or fake, particularly on social media platforms like Instagram Live. The mention of "BasedNas" refers to rapper Lil B, known as The BasedGod, and his influence on the singer's lyrical style. The lyrics end with a statement of readiness to confront any challengers who may come their way.<br></p><p><u>Ayo, Dyc, where you at, bro?</u><br>Calling out to Dyc, asking for his
