Alongside his family, Ryan has amassed over 40 million subscribers and 50 billion total views on his channels. He is one of the highest-paid YouTube personalities in the world and has licensed his name and likeness to over 5,000 products.</p><p>The family has also expanded their brand to include a show on Nickelodeon, a line of self-produced toys and merchandise, and even an original series deal with Hulu. Ryan’s most popular video, “Huge Eggs Surprise Toys Challenge,” has over 2 billion views and ranks among the 40 most-viewed videos on YouTube.</p><p>His mother left her job as a high school teacher to work on the channel full time, and in November 2020, Ryan’s superhero alter-ego was featured in a float during the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade.</p><h2><span id=Ryan_Kajis_Massive_Earnings_on_YouTube>Ryan Kaji’s Massive Earnings on YouTube</span></h2><p>Ryan Kaji, the child star of the YouTube channel Ryan’s World, has been making big bucks on the platform since 2016. In 2017, the channel brought in over $11 million in revenue. The following year, Ryan became the highest-paid YouTuber with $22 million in revenue. He continued his streak in 2019 with more than $26 million in earnings. The Kaji family’s success on the platform only grew in 2020, earning a whopping $30 million and securing their title as the highest-paid personalities on YouTube. Overall, Ryan and his parents have earned over $100 million from their media empire.</p><h2><span id=Ryan_Kaji_Early_Life_and_Background>Ryan Kaji: Early Life and Background</span></h2><p>Ryan Kaji was born in Texas on October 6, 2011 to parents Shion and Loann. His father is Japanese and his mother is of Vietnamese descent; they met as undergraduate students at Texas Tech University. Kaji has twin sisters named Kate and Emma, and the family resides in Cypress, Texas.</p><h2><span id=Ryan_Kajis_YouTube_Channel_Ryans_World>Ryan Kaji’s YouTube Channel, Ryan’s World</span></h2><p>Ryan Kaji started making YouTube videos in 2015, initially under the name Ryan ToysReview and later changed to Ryan’s World. Kaji’s mother quit her job to work full-time on the channel, which features Kaji unboxing, playing with, and reviewing toys. The videos are sponsored by toy companies, and the most popular video, “Huge Eggs Surprise Toys Challenge,” has over two billion views. The channel has expanded to include videos of Kaji doing everyday activities with his family. By the end of 2020, Ryan’s World had over 28 million subscribers and 45 billion views, making Kaji the highest-paid YouTube star according to Forbes. Kaji’s parents claim that most of the toys featured on the channel are donated to charity or given away to friends and family.</p><h2><span id=Ryans_World_Expands_Beyond_YouTube>Ryan’s World Expands Beyond YouTube</span></h2><p>Ryan’s World, the YouTube channel that features young host Ryan Kaji, has expanded its commercial success by launching a line of apps, television series, video games, and other commodities. In 2017, Kaji’s parents signed a deal with PocketWatch, a startup children’s media company, which handles marketing and merchandise for Ryan’s World. The family created a children’s gaming app called “Tag with Ryan” in 2018, in collaboration with WildWorks.</p><p>The following year, Ryan’s World and PocketWatch produced a 20-episode preschooler television series entitled “Ryan’s Mystery Playdate,” which aired on Nick Jr. Also released in 2019 was the video game “Race with Ryan,” a racing game available for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Microsoft Windows, and the Nintendo Switch.</p><p>In November of 2020, Ryan’s World premiered a hybrid live-action/animated series on Amazon Kids+ entitled “Super Spy Ryan.” The next month, it was announced that an official Ryan’s World game would be launched on the popular gaming platform Roblox. The channel also collaborated with PocketWatch and Bonkers Toys to create a line of toys, initially exclusive to Walmart in the summer of 2018. The line features slime, action figures, stuffed animals, T-shirts, and more.</p><h2><span id=Controversies_Surrounding_Ryans_World>Controversies Surrounding Ryan’s World</span></h2><p>Ryan’s World, the popular YouTube channel featuring young Ryan Kaji, has been the subject of controversy in recent years. Some critics argue that the channel and Kaji’s parents exploit the young boy for profit, potentially leading to overworking and coercion. Kaji’s mother has denied these allegations, stating that her son is in charge of his own schedule.</p><p>In addition, the channel has faced criticism for not properly disclosing sponsored content. Truth in Advertising and the Federal Trade Commission filed a complaint in 2019, claiming that around 90% of the channel’s videos feature paid product advertisements aimed at young viewers who may not understand the difference between a review and a commercial. The videos have also been criticized for promoting unhealthy foods.</p><p>As a result of the complaint, the FTC sued YouTube and Google for $170 million, and YouTube has since changed its rules to comply with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act.</p><h2>You May Also Like</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiopaG9ta3SraCcZpOkunC%2B2JqlZqORn7ZuusStZLCnoqm1cA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fryan-kaji-net-worth.html&text=Ryan%20Kaji%20Net%20Worth%20-%20Pulptastic&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fryan-kaji-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fryan-kaji-net-worth.html&title=Ryan%20Kaji%20Net%20Worth%20-%20Pulptastic" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fryan-kaji-net-worth.html&title=Ryan%20Kaji%20Net%20Worth%20-%20Pulptastic" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fryan-kaji-net-worth.html&title=Ryan%20Kaji%20Net%20Worth%20-%20Pulptastic" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fryan-kaji-net-worth.html&description=Ryan%20Kaji%20Net%20Worth%20-%20Pulptastic" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./the-real-reason-morgan-wallen-went-to-rehab.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Real Reason Morgan Wallen Went To Rehab">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./pear-arugula-chickpea-salad.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Pear &amp;amp; Arugula Chickpea Salad">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
