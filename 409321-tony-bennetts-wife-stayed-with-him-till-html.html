The "Love for Sale" star was impressed to see a young woman so fascinated by his music, so much so that he did not only take a picture with Crow but he asked her to be his date for the rest of the evening.</p><p class=dh>This meet-cute happened in 1985 and began the couple's long love story. Crow used to work as a school teacher and was the owner of Creative Artists Management in Manhattan. The couple combined their love for art and started a <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/tony-bennett-and-susan-benedettos-relationship-timeline/>joint nonprofit organization</a> to advocate for arts education in 1999, after ten years of dating.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/2aae78b2b38413cf4ea2d9d957759469ecce3352e806def5b366455babf51b94.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Tony Bennett and his wife Susan Crow in New York in 2019 | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>Bennett felt lucky to have Crow as his wife. He expressed his gratitude in an Instagram post he shared on her birthday. He <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.instagram.com/p/CiSWVq0A2fI/?hl=en">wrote</a>, "Susan, you put a smile on my face every day… happy birthday to my lovely wife."</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Tony Bennett’s Battle with Alzheimer’s</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>The impact Bennett had with his music was amazing. The "Body and Soul" singer had a career spanning over seven decades. He released <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.tmz.com/2023/07/21/tony-bennett-dead-dies-singer/>over 70 albums</a> which won him 19 Grammys.</p><p class=dh>Unfortunately, the singer was diagnosed with Alzheimer's in 2016, and his wife was his caregiver until his last breath. Bennett had one of his last interviews on "60 Minutes" and could hardly hold a conversation.</p><p class=dh>But despite his illness, Bennett still wanted to get back on stage. When asked about one of his performances with singer Lady Gaga, the singer did not seem to remember.</p><p class=dh>Crow was there to lead most of the conversation, but one thing the singer is said to have always remembered was his name. As a performer, his name meant a lot to him and his supporters.</p><p class=dh>Sadly his wife revealed that Bennett did not know <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIMuacCUgGY">he had Alzheimer's</a>. Even though things were tough, Crow felt they were fortunate in many ways. Crow and Bennett were last spotted walking together in New York. The 56-year-old was seen holding her husband's hand as he tried to <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.tmz.com/2023/07/21/tony-bennett-dead-dies-singer/>sign an autograph</a> for a fan.</p><p class=dh>The Grammy award-winning singer was wearing a matching blue tracksuit and tried his best to interact with the <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.tmz.com/2023/07/21/tony-bennett-dead-dies-singer/>paparazzi's questions</a>. One of the reasons Crow felt that their family was lucky was because of the amount of help they received.</p><p class=dh>She credited one of the singer's sons, Danny, for managing Bennett's business affairs as well as the amazing team of medical doctors that helped him. Crow was also grateful that her husband always remembered who she and his children were.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/dadf8f9e3573958b7e23bbc5c6b8632112c2d934bf71338364afd8899c391adc.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Tony Bennett in California in 2017 | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>Bennett was born in Astoria, Queens, on August 3, 1926, and left an <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://people.com/music/who-is-susan-benedetto-tony-bennett-wife/#:~:text=She%20explained%20that,he%20still%20is.%22">impact with his music</a>.
