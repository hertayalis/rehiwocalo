They have been combing through surveillance footage and tracing Brown’s digital footprint for leads.</p><p>Brown’s former NFL teams have also expressed shock and concern over his disappearance, hoping for his safe return. As word has spread nationally, NFL players who knew Brown have taken to social media asking fans for potential information.</p><p><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Golden Moore</a> Relative of Brown Family Shared the concern on Facebook about missing news of his Cousin:-</strong></p><p>Our Family needs yall help!

He had a career in the NFL, playing for teams like the New England Patriots, Indianapolis Colts, Atlanta Falcons, Jacksonville Jaguars, and Buffalo Bills before retiring in 2016.</p><p>Sergio’s family has been trying to contact him without success, and his whereabouts remain unknown. Law enforcement authorities are actively investigating, and the community’s help is crucial.</p><p>If you have ANY information about Sergio Brown’s location or circumstances, please:</p><p>Contact the Maywood Police Department’s anonymous tip line at (708) 450-1787</p><p>Your assistance can make a significant difference in finding Sergio and providing answers to his family during this difficult time.
