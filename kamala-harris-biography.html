Harris happens to be the first female Vice President of America.</strong></p><p>Harris was born on October 20th, 1964 in Oakland, California in the United States of America. She was born to Donald J. Harris and Shyamala Gopalan. She shares the same parents with her sister, Maya Harris who happens to be a lawyer, public policy advocate and a writer.</p><p>Harris relocated to Champaign, Illinois in 1966 after her parents accepted employment at the University of Illinois (where her younger sister Maya was born). Both parents worked at many universities in quick succession while the family relocated about the Midwest.</p><p>In 1970, Harris returned to California together with her mother and sister while her father stayed in the Midwest. They first spent some time at a duplex on Bancroft Way in West Berkeley, which is also known as the “flatlands,” before spending a short time on Milvia Street in the heart of Berkeley.</p><p>Harris was bused as part of Berkeley’s comprehensive desegregation program when she started kindergarten to Thousand Oaks Elementary School, a public school in a wealthier area of northern Berkeley[24] that was previously 95 percent white but is now 40 percent Black as a result of the desegregation plan’s implementation.</p><p>The Harris girls and their mother also routinely visited an African American cultural center. The Harris girls and their mother were regularly taken by a neighbor to an African American church in Oakland where they sang in the children’s choir. Their mother took them to a local Hindu temple where she sung from time to time and introduced them to Hinduism.</p><p>She and her sister made frequent trips to their mother’s home in Madras (now Chennai) when they were little. She claims that her maternal grandpa P. V. Gopalan, a retired Indian civil servant whose progressive views on democracy and women’s rights impacted her, had a significant influence on her.</p><p>Throughout her adult life, Harris has maintained contact with her Indian aunts and uncles. Harris has also traveled to Jamaica to see her father’s relatives. When she was seven, her parents got divorced. According to Harris, other neighborhood kids refused to let her and her sister play with them because they were black when they visited their father in Palo Alto on the weekends.</p><p>When Harris was twelve, her mother relocated to Montreal, Quebec, where Shyamala had taken a job as a research and teaching assistant at the Jewish General Hospital, which is linked with McGill University.</p><p>Harris graduated from Westmount High School in Westmount, Quebec, in 1981 after attending Notre-Dame-des-Neiges Primary School, FACE School, and Westmount High School.</p><p>Harris enrolled at Howard University, a historically black college in Washington, D.C., in 1982 after graduating from high school. She worked as a mail room clerk for California senator Alan Cranston during her internship at Howard, served as chair of the economics society, was in charge of the debate team, and joined the sorority Alpha Kappa Alpha.</p><p>Harris earned a political science and economics degree from Howard in 1986. Harris subsequently went back to California to enroll in the Legal Education Opportunity Program at the University of California, Hastings College of the Law (LEOP).</p><p>She presided over the Black Law Students Association chapter at UC Hastings while she was a student there. In June 1990, she was admitted to the California Bar after earning her Juris Doctor in 1989.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Kamala Harris nationality</h2><p>Harris was born in Oakland, California in the United States of America.

She is a member of the Democratic Party.</p><p>Harris earned law degrees from the University of California Hastings College of the Law and Howard University. Before being hired by the San Francisco District Attorney’s Office and later the San Francisco City Attorney’s Office, she started her career in the Alameda County District Attorney’s Office.</p><p>She was chosen as San Francisco’s district attorney in 2003. She was chosen as California’s attorney general in 2010 and then again in 2014. From 2017 until 2021, Harris represented California as a junior US senator.</p><p>In the 2016 Senate race, Harris defeated Loretta Sanchez to become the first South Asian American and the second African American woman to hold the office.</p><p>She supported the DREAM Act, healthcare reform, federal cannabis decriminalization, a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants, a prohibition on assault weapons, and progressive tax reform while serving as a senator.</p><p>She rose to national prominence for her incisive questions during Senate hearings of members of the Trump administration, notably Brett Kavanaugh, Trump’s second choice for the Supreme Court who had been accused of sexual assault.</p><p>Prior to the primaries, Harris withdrew from consideration for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination. She was chosen by Joe Biden to be his running mate, and their team won the 2020 election by defeating Donald Trump and Mike Pence, the incumbent president and vice president.</p><p>When President Joe Biden and Harris were sworn in on January 20, 2021, Harris was named vice president.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Kamala Harris family and siblings</h2><p>Harris was born to Donald J.
