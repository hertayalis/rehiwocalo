They married in <strong>1971</strong> in a private ceremony where they exchanged their vows in the presence of close friends and family.&nbsp;</p><p>Interestingly,<strong> &nbsp;</strong>Paxton was thirty-four, and Patricia was thirty-one at the time of their marriage.</p><p>After fifteen years of marriage, the ex-couple Paxton and Patricia divorced in <strong>1986</strong>. They kept their divorce reason a secret to stay away from the limelight and media attention. Therefore, the exact reason for their divorce has not been disclosed till now.</p><h2>About Patricia's Husband: Where Is He Now?</h2><p>Paxton Whitehead, aka Edwin Francis Paxton Whitehead, is a versatile British actor. He is not only famous among the public for his fantastic acting skills but also his direction and playwright. He was born on <strong>October 17, 1937</strong>, in Larkfield, Kent, England.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2022/8/18/paxton_whitehead-min-1660801438039.jpg><p>Whitehead started his career as a theatre actor in <strong>1949</strong>. Later, he made his Broadway debut with his play&nbsp;<i>The Affair&nbsp;</i>in 1962.

Their daughter's name is <strong>Heather Whitehead.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>However, they have not talked much about their daughter on any media. Additionally, they have put their daughter, Heather Whitehead, out of the media exposure to this date.&nbsp;</p><p>Like other celebrity divorce cases, this ex-couple, Paxton and Patricia, also fought with each other for the <strong>custody </strong>of their child. After several months of battling in case, Patricia was granted her daughter's custody authority. Likewise, Paxton&nbsp;was granted the right to visit her daughter.&nbsp;</p><h2>Rumours About Patricia's Divorce</h2><p>According to rumours, Heather Whitehead was not a child of Paxton.

Since then, she lived with her daughter, Heather Whitehead, till her death.&nbsp;</p><h2>About Patricia's&nbsp;Ex-Husband Current Relationship&nbsp;</h2><p>As mentioned earlier, the lovely couple Paxton and Katherine are married and still together, bonded by their love bond. It has been thirty-five years since they married, and they are hoping for their ruby anniversary.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2022/8/23/paxton_katherineresized-min-1661251429843.jpg><p>Katherine and Paxton have been blessed with two children, a son and a daughter. <strong>Sarah Whitehead</strong> is the lovely daughter, whereas their son's name is <strong>Charles Whitehead</strong>.&nbsp;</p><h2>Who Was The First Love of Patricia Gage?</h2><p><i>Rabid </i>actress Patricia, aka Pat, never openly said she had dated anyone before Paxton Whitehead.
