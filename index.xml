Because of the studs on the manifold, it may not be necessary to replace the carburetor gasket, but it can‚Äôt hurt.</description></item><item><title>Ezra Raymond Pouech Obituary News: 30 year old oakland man identified as victim in fatal pacifica st</title><link>/ezra-raymond-pouech-obituary-news.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>youremail@domain.com (Some Person)</author><guid>/ezra-raymond-pouech-obituary-news.html</guid><description>A Fatal Stabbing in Pacifica: Tragic Domestic Violence Incident Claims the Life of Oakland Man
