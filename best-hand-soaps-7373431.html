After experiencing the incredible scent of this gentle hand wash from Grown Alchemist in the bathroom of a Delta lounge, I was hooked. Little did I know that the ingredients list made up mostly of natural botanical oils, was also exactly the mix of hydration that the dermatologists ordered.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Fennel seed, cedarwood, and rosemary leaf oil contain antimicrobial and antiseptic properties, and work together as natural cleansers. Coconut oil releases triglycerides that soften skin, while cold pressed sweet orange oil is rich with antioxidants to clarify and smooth skin. Sweet almond oil soothes irritated skin and helps it retain moisture. Top off all that natural goodness with a refreshing scent that subtly blends notes of citrus, cedarwood, and herbs, and we bet you’ll be looking to wash your hands as frequently as possible.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type: </strong>Liquid | <strong>Scents: </strong>3 | <strong>Size: </strong>16.9 fl oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-mrs-meyers-clean-day-rain-water-foaming-hand-soap></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Budget</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Mrs. Meyers Clean Day Rain Water Foaming Hand Soap</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Mrs. Meyers Clean Day Rain Water Foaming Hand Soap" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/93TzSUtBLfR6wemRx-SJHfvADBI=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/mrs-meyers-clean-day-rain-water-foaming-hand-soap-036e939ebdda4281918ca9a257185ab8.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Mrs. Meyers</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This foaming hand wash offered the freshest scent of any soap we tested and left our hands feeling super hydrated; we also appreciated the recyclable/refillable packaging.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> It's easy to go through foam hand soaps quickly, so you may be refilling the bottle frequently.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This very affordable foaming hand wash could have easily been our best overall pick. We love the rich lather provided by the lightweight foam that rinses clean in a snap. Our hands felt softer (never slimy!) after every wash, thanks to a mix of essential oils, aloe vera, glycerin, and olive oil. It’s paraben-, phthalate-, and artificial color-free, making the formula gentle enough for even the most sensitive skin to use regularly. The hand soap even comes in packaging that is fully recyclable, and the brand will soon sell refills so you can reuse the original container over and over.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">And the rain water scent?

Its creamy texture offers a dermatologist-backed blend of nourishing vitamins B3 and B5, along with glycerin, to thoroughly cleanse skin without leaving it feel dry or taut. It’s also unscented, ensuring no risk of a reaction to fragrance. And, as many of us with sensitive skin know, this cleanser is also gentle enough for use on your face.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type: </strong>Cream | <strong>Scent: </strong>Unscented | <strong>Size: </strong>16 fl oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-smelling-homecourt-neroli-leaf-hand-wash></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Smelling</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Homecourt Neroli Leaf Hand Wash</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Homecourt Neroli Leaf Hand Wash" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/_rD2frCn6A3lSS_QNw5RPUhoNfg=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/homecourt-neroli-leaf-hand-wash-cf917cad37f244e6b82f0c338ba8ac7a.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Homecourt</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The scent lasts and lasts.

It’s fresh and floral and reminds us of the interior of a tropical greenhouse, instantly sending our olfactory glands into vacation mode every time we wash our hands.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Scent is, of course, not everything when it comes to an effective hand soap. Its gel-like formula quickly turns into a bubbling lather, and with a duo of natural moisturizers, argan oil and Australian hibiscus flower extract, our hands never dried out. In fact, it felt so lovely to wash our hands with this soap, we took our time while doing it.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type: </strong>Liquid | <strong>Scents: </strong>4 | <strong>Size: </strong>12 fl oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-dry-skin-kiehls-liquid-hand-soap></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Dry Skin</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Kiehl’s Liquid Hand Soap</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Kiehl&amp;acirc;s Liquid Hand Soap " style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/PHOkrirXKRkG4xjumKSAt_piuoA=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/kiehls-liquid-hand-soap--e9545228328943f7a52a08b298097de4.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Kiehlâs</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The non-drying formula includes aloe vera, chamomile, and vitamin E to deliver soothing moisture whenever you wash your hands, making it especially great for the kitchen, where dry hands are a particular concern.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> It lathers nicely, but it takes longer to suds up than some options.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you spend a lot of time in the kitchen, dry hands are probably a huge concern.

The gentle formula features hydrating, rejuvenating ingredients, like aloe vera, chamomile, and vitamin E to repair any existing dryness and prevent future dehydration. We also love to place the grapefruit scent right next to our kitchen sink.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type: </strong>Liquid | <strong>Scents: </strong>1 | <strong>Size: </strong>6.8 fl oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-moisturizing-loccitane-shea-hands-and-body-ultra-rich-wash></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Moisturizing</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>L'Occitane Shea Ultra-Rich Wash</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="L'Occitane Shea Butter Ultra Rich Hand Wash" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/zDrK5vkIASwt5GY3kHDZawDLYFE=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/LOccitane-Shea-Butter-Ultra-Rich-Hand-Wash-3ea4df13583d4fbeae70deeb2e69a046.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The texture feels more like a moisturizer than a soap and leaves hands feeling silky soft.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The rich, creamy consistency may not appeal to all.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re looking to add extra moisture to your hand washing routine, this cream soap from legendary French brand L’Occitane is a favorite of board-certified dermatologist Dr. Corey L. Hartman. The dense, creamy consistency feels decadent on hands, and the key ingredient, shea butter, is rich in omega 6 and 3 to instantly add a serious dose of moisture back to your skin. It’s a luxurious hand washing experience that will leave your hands soft all day long.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type: </strong>Cream | <strong>Scents: </strong>1 | <strong>Size: </strong>10.7 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-foaming-jr-watkins-foaming-hand-soap-with-pump-dispenser></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Foaming</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>J.R.

It lathers quickly and rinses fully, without leaving behind any hint of residue or film. Also, since its largely plant-based, it avoids using any chemical ingredients, making the formula mild enough for those with sensitive or reactive skin. Not to mention, the packaging is attractive and it comes in almost any scent you can imagine.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type: </strong>Foaming | <strong>Scents: </strong>12 | <strong>Size: </strong>9 fl oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-liquid-co-bigelow-hand-wash></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Liquid</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>C.O.

Bigelow has been the trusted pharmacist of New York’s Greenwich Village for generations. They're especially known for their own line of bath and body products, including an excellent collection of hand washes. Available in a wide range of scents, from earthy verbena to fruity coconut, this hand wash evolves from a gel into a rich, full-bodied lather easily. The formula features a blend of moisturizing ingredients, like pro-vitamin B5 and aloe vera, and is paraben- and SLS-free. The packaging and bottle shape are as classic as the pharmacy itself, making this an excellent option for anyone who prefers a liquid soap.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type: </strong>Liquid | <strong>Scents: </strong>9 | <strong>Size: </strong>10 fl oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-natural-dr-bronners-pure-castile-liquid-soap></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Natural</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Dr. Bronner’s Pure-Castile Liquid Soap</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Dr. Bronner&amp;acirc;s Pure-Castile Liquid Soap" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/PKsD7d6PXEJ-2pFqFjMN7sUsuJg=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/dr-bronners-pure-castile-liquid-soap-db4ffddabc444813ab385a2eeefae6f4.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> It’s completely natural, certified fair trade, comes in 100% post-consumer recycled packaging and you can use it for way more things than just washing your hands.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> It isn’t counter-ready: This soap is concentrated and needs to be diluted before use.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Dr. Bonner’s is beloved by eco-conscious backpackers and campers the world over, and for good reason. The Spanish soap making tradition of the Castile region from which the soap derives its name, utilizes only all-natural plant oils. That means a few things: First, this soap is 100% vegan, and second, it avoids using any harsh lab-produced detergents, which make it completely non-toxic and biodegradable.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It's important to note that this soap arrives in a concentrated form, so you'll need to combine the soapy solution with water before sudsing up.

Paloroma’s Main Squeeze Gentle Hand Wash is derived from plant extracts, altogether avoiding harsh chemicals that can cause irritation on all types of skin. Of course, that means it’s paraben-, phthalate-, silicone-, sulfate-, petrolatum-, dye-, and fragrance-free, which just happen to be all the things that our dermatologists say those with sensitive skin should avoid. The clean formula also features a variety of soothing ingredients, like chamomile, aloe vera, and rose, to help alleviate any skin irritation you might be experiencing. And while it’s technically a baby product, the packaging is adorable and appropriate for adults, too; we have no shame displaying it on our bathroom counter.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type: </strong>Liquid | <strong>Scents: </strong>Unscented | <strong>Size: </strong>10 fl oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-luxury-krigler-bar-soap></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Luxury</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Krigler Bar Soap</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Krigler Bar Soap" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/CUQ140F32-IUDuSgdvrUsHIQ3js=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/krigler-bar-soap-a92941982e14486a828bd7752791c276.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Krigler</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>French milled soap is the epitome of luxury when it comes to washing your hands, and these delightful soaps come in a range of colors and scents that are perfect for showing off in your powder room.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>Bar soaps can be difficult to store on the counter.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re looking for a luxurious hand washing experience, French milled soap is world-renowned and these pretty bars of soap from the perfume maker Krigler are a fun splurge for your powder room. With intoxicating scents, the beautifully formed and logo-embossed discs come in a range of pastel shades that remind us of colorful French macaroons. Produced from natural plant materials through a process called saponification, the soaps are milled not once, but three times, before being molded into bars. The result is a hand washing experience that is second to none. The lather is abundant, the scents are divine, the rinse is speedy, and the natural, moisturizing ingredients leave your hands feeling silky.

They are sulfate-, phthalate-, and paraben-free, and instead filled with nourishing and hydrating natural vitamins and minerals. Formulated with a trio of impressively conditioning natural ingredients — coconut oil, olive oil, and shea butter — hands feel moisturized, supple, and buttery soft after each wash, even in the winter.

Dr. Murphy-Rose agrees that it’s important to seek out ingredients that will be gentle on your hands, but she also recommends avoiding polyethylene glycols (PEGs), sodium lauryl sulfates (SLSs), and sodium laureth sulfates (SLESs), all of which are very harsh on the skin.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">To combat the drying effects further, you should look for hydrating ingredients, says Dr. Hartman, like glycerin, olive oil, and shea butter. But be wary of the claims of natural ingredients, warns Dr. Murphy-Rose. “Just because an ingredient is all-natural does not mean it will be gentle on the skin,” she says. “Oftentimes patients experience reactions to ingredients like botanicals or plant extracts.”</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Texture</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">All three dermatologists agreed that there isn't one "ideal" hand soap texture; it all comes down to personal preference. “Some people may love the feel of a thicker cream soap," says Dr. Harman. "Others may like a lightweight foaming soap."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Dr. Murphy-Rose prefers foaming hand soaps because they are mild, lather nicely, and rinse off easily. However, some may find foams to be too lightweight. When considering a hand soap texture, like gel, liquid, cream, foam, or bar, it's simply about the experience you find most enjoyable.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Fragrance</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While fragrance is something that many people avoid when it comes to skincare, hand care is altogether different. “Some of my favorite hand soaps have a slight fragrance that makes hands smell nice,” says Dr. Hartman, who adds that only those with sensitive or reactive skin should steer clear of scent.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">There are plenty of fragrance options to choose from, as well as varying degrees of subtlety. Go with whatever strikes your fancy, and don't be shy about swapping out your scented soaps for every season. Maybe you’d prefer a citrus aroma to mask cooking odors in your kitchen or an aromatherapy blend for your bathroom. There’s no wrong answer or right scent.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Eco-Friendly</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Almost any hand soap container can be refilled, but some brands do a better job than others reminding us of that fact. Others take it a step even further by offering refills in bulk packaging. Don’t let bar soaps off the hook just because they dissolve – remember that they came in some sort of packaging to start. Always pay attention to what materials your beauty products come in and whether they can be recycled.

While traditional bar soap carries a lot of stigma, “we do much better now, so it’s fine to head to your local drug store,” she says. And Dr. Hartman agrees, saying that “many brands use the phrases ‘hand soap’ and ‘hand wash’ interchangeably, so just take a look at which ingredients are right for you when choosing.”</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Is antibacterial soap better?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">All three dermatologists agree: You do not need to use an antibacterial soap every time you wash your hands. “There is actually no data that shows that an antibacterial hand soap is better than a non-antibacterial hand soap at killing germs,” says Dr. Hartman. “The skin has millions of bacteria on it – some of which is healthy for your overall skin microbiome.

That said, in circumstances where disinfection is a key concern, Dr. Murphy-Rose reminds us that antimicrobial soaps are important and even life saving. “Before performing surgery, surgeons always use antimicrobial soaps to reduce microorganism contamination while operating,” she says. “But most people going about their usual routine do not need the same level of decontamination.”</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-shop-with-us></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why Shop with Us?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Peter Tittiger</a> is a contributing writer at InStyle, Byrdie, and WWD Shop.
