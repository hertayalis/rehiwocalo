His main source of wealth is <strong>Facebook</strong> and <strong>Venture Capital.</strong></p><p>Palihapitiya was paid well while he worked on Facebook (FB), and he was also rewarded with generous bonuses for his efforts.</p><p>He put his money into several promising businesses, especially into startups that paid off handsomely in a short period of time.</p><p><strong>Pure Storage, Bumptop</strong> (later purchased by <strong>Google</strong>), <strong>Playdom</strong> (later purchased by <strong>Disney</strong>), and <strong>Palantir</strong> are some of the ventures that helped grow his fortune.</p><p>In late 2019, he financed a blank-check corporation that joined with <strong>Virgin Galactic</strong>, a space venture.</p><p>However, In early March, he sold a major portion of his Virgin Galactic interest for $200 million.</p><p>Since then, the former Facebook executive has funded <strong>SPAC IPOs</strong> for Opendoor, an online real estate startup, and <strong>Clover Health</strong>, a health insurance provider.</p><p>He has three additional blank-check companies on the market, one in talks to go public with personal finance company SoFi.</p><p>Similarly, Palihapitiya claimed in 2013 that he held the equivalent of $5 million in Bitcoin and that he hoped to possess up to $15 million.</p><h2>Chamath Palihapitiya&nbsp;Lifestyle & Vacations</h2><h3>Lifestyle</h3><p>Chamath is a very family-oriented individual who enjoys spending time with his loved ones.</p><p>He is an enthusiastic blogger who has contributed various technical and personal essays to ‘<strong>A Medium Corporation.</strong>‘</p><p>Likewise, he traces his view to his upbringing in all three nations, having lived in Sri Lanka, Canada, and the United States.</p><p>Being a skilled poker player he is, his poker skills are one of the most impressive.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Chamath_Palihapitiya_poker-player.jpg><p>Although this may be true, he made it big because of Facebook, but most people agree that Palihapitiya’s renown stems mostly from his philosophical views, which he is not afraid to share.</p><p>While some can portray him as not so fun, the reality is different as he enjoys traveling in elegance, joins the college team in national competitions, and lays a large Super Bowl bet in&nbsp; Las Vegas.</p><h3>Vacations</h3><p>He manages to live life to the fullest regardless of him engaging in different controversies.</p><p>In March, Palihapitiya visited <strong>Milan</strong> on his private jet, which he purchased for $75million.</p><p>As a user’s guide, Milan’s location makes it ideal for a day or weekend excursion to the beach, with several beaches only a couple of hours away.</p><p>With their refreshing winds and azure waves, the 12 beaches near Milan allow you to enjoy the nice side of the humidity.</p><p>He also loves visiting <strong>Caribbean Island</strong> from time to time.</p><h2>Chamath Palihapitiya: House, Car, Jet, Watches</h2><h3>House</h3><p>He lives in&nbsp;<span class=css-1n63hu8>Palo Alto, California</span>, United <span class=Cite__wrapper data-cite-id=1239011><span class=Cite__highlight>States, with his girlfriend, Nathalie Dompe.</span></span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Chamath_2-house.jpg><p>According to Business Insider, Palihapitiya conducts poker events at his house in Palo Alto with several friends daily.</p><h3>Car</h3><p>He also announced that he was the first person to order a <strong>Renovo Coupe</strong>, an electric supercar set to debut later this year.</p><p>Renovo is powered by twin electric sequential motors with a combined output of 500 horsepower and 1,000 pound-feet torque.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/chamath-car.jpg><p>Summery, in short, this lavish motor is expected to cost $529,000, according to reports.</p><h3>&nbsp;Private Jet</h3><p>According to Bloomberg News, Palihapitiya bought a $75 million <strong>Bombardier Global 7500</strong> the ultra-long-range business jets in 2020.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/bomabardier.jpg><p>The longer, four-zone cabin 7500 is based on the Global 6000 with a redesigned transonic wing and has a range of 7,700 nautical miles that is 14,300 km.</p><h3>Watches</h3><p>Unlike other tech billionaires, Chamath knows how to display himself. The brands represented among his powerful watch collection are Richard Mille, Audemars Piguet, and A Lange & Sohne.</p><h4>Audemars Piguet</h4><p>He wears a 41mm Audemars Piguet Royal Oak Double Balance Wheel Open-Worked Rose-Gold.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/audemar.jpg><p>This is a very colorful watch, not only because of the color and meticulous handwork but also because of the technical brilliance of the additional balance wheel, which improves reliability and accuracy.</p><h4>A Lange & Sohne</h4><p>Palihapitiya also wears watches by the German brand A Lange & Sohne, whose timepieces are regarded as “grails” by Haute horologists.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/lange-sahne.jpg><p>The watch displays the date, day of the week, month, and leap year, with no need for adjustment until 2100.</p><h4>Richard Mille</h4><p>Last but not least, his Richard Mille RM035 Rafael Nadal line watch is perhaps the most flexing in Palihapitiya’s watch collection.</p><p>However, wearing a Richard Mille watch almost always ensures that you are the person wearing the watch with the most engineering on display, even among the super-rich.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/richard-mills.jpg><p>The manually wound RM035 timepiece has a 55-hour power reserve, weighs only 4.3 grams, and is strong enough to resist being strapped to Nadal’s wrist on the court.</p><p>In short, he knows how to and what to flex in particular events.</p><h2>Chamath Palihapitiya Investments, Endorsements & Book Publications</h2><h3>Investments</h3><p>Palihapitiya created his own fund, The Social+Capital Partnership, after leaving Facebook, through which he invested in several firms, including Yammer and Slack.</p><p>Furthermore, In 2015, the Social+Capital Partnership was renamed Social Capital.</p><p>Some of the other
