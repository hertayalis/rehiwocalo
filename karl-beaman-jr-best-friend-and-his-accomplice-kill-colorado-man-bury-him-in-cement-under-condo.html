The tip received from Beaman's mother claimed that the 36-year-old had been missing since last summer. A search warrant was obtained by the Aurora police detectives who discovered the concealed grave under concrete. Detectives are still carrying out the task of excavation with contractors to recover the body which is expected to last through the end of the week.&nbsp; The cause of Beaman's death will be determined by the Arapahoe County Coroner's Office.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/91c9729b-7d7c-4ed3-9d45-b66ccb2666b8.png><h2 class=split>The victim's mother hired a private investigator</h2><p>Beaman Jr's mother called the Aurora Police Department about her missing son last Saturday, April 1, stating that she had not spoken with him since May 2022. She said that her son had a friend named Haskel Leroy Crawford, often referred to as "Leroy" who "possibly jumped Karl at some point" which she believed was over the two of them nearly being caught stealing catalytic converters. She also told that she had reported him missing to the Arvada Police Department. She further went on to say that she had hired a private investigator and that she came to know the two had been associated with shady activities.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/28a4c9b6-4854-4c03-af70-084ddc06965c.png><h2 class=split>Beaman's mother started a Facebook page</h2><p>Beaman's mother started a Facebook page to find him and received messages from one user with the name "Nope TryAgain" claiming that "he's buried under Casie bocks apartment. in the crawlspace. under cement. her and Leroy did it. I'm sorry," as per <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">New York Post</a>. The user stated that Beaman's body was in the crawlspace where he was buried in a shallow grave and covered in cement.&nbsp;</p><p>The tipster said that while Bock was high, she allegedly spilled the beans about the murder and told them Crawford had killed Beaman after accusing him of being a police informant, according to the document. On April 3, the authorities received another tip with the exact same details that Beaman's mother had informed them. When police met with the tipster, they said that they did not know Bock personally but their children went to school together. Bock asked the tipster three months ago if the person could watch her children and take them to school. They noted she appeared to be high on meth.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/fcbabd25-6220-405d-8570-aa6cfa4892ce.png><p>As Bock went out of control in the last three weeks, she told the tipster Crawford killed Beaman inside their apartment and he was buried in a “shallow” grave beneath her building. The duo placed cement over the victim to help mask the smell, she said.</p><p>Bock claimed that she did not commit the murder but helped with the cleanup and moving of the body, according to the affidavit. She told the cops that Crawford and Beaman “are best friends.” She also informed them that he had just recently came back into her life. Bock apparently returned home from work one day and found Crawford, with Beaman lying on the ground with a plastic bag over his head.</p><h2 class=split>Who is Haskel Leroy Crawford?</h2><p>Haskel Leroy Crawford was slapped with the first-degree murder of his crime buddy Karl Beaman Jr. Crawford reportedly claimed that he killed Beaman to protect his family. He threatened Bock to help him hide Beaman's body. The 38-year-old was incarcerated in Jefferson County at the time of his arrest in the Aurora homicide case. He was being held in Jefferson County as a suspect in an unrelated investigation.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRoo5GnuW6uxJqkmqZdn79ursSsq2aeop6yr7CMmqWdZZiewG6twpympqicnrCmecqio6Vlk6S5sL7AnaZmpZGjeqPB0bJkoaGdYravecKepJ6mpGLCr7DEq2Scp56ZvA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fkarl-beaman-jr-best-friend-and-his-accomplice-kill-colorado-man-bury-him-in-cement-under-condo.html&text=Karl%20Beaman%20Jr%3a%20Best%20friend%20and%20his%20accomplice%20kill%20Colorado%20man%2c%20bury%20him%20in%20cement%20under%20condo&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fkarl-beaman-jr-best-friend-and-his-accomplice-kill-colorado-man-bury-him-in-cement-under-condo.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fkarl-beaman-jr-best-friend-and-his-accomplice-kill-colorado-man-bury-him-in-cement-under-condo.html&title=Karl%20Beaman%20Jr%3a%20Best%20friend%20and%20his%20accomplice%20kill%20Colorado%20man%2c%20bury%20him%20in%20cement%20under%20condo" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fkarl-beaman-jr-best-friend-and-his-accomplice-kill-colorado-man-bury-him-in-cement-under-condo.html&title=Karl%20Beaman%20Jr%3a%20Best%20friend%20and%20his%20accomplice%20kill%20Colorado%20man%2c%20bury%20him%20in%20cement%20under%20condo" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fkarl-beaman-jr-best-friend-and-his-accomplice-kill-colorado-man-bury-him-in-cement-under-condo.html&title=Karl%20Beaman%20Jr%3a%20Best%20friend%20and%20his%20accomplice%20kill%20Colorado%20man%2c%20bury%20him%20in%20cement%20under%20condo" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fkarl-beaman-jr-best-friend-and-his-accomplice-kill-colorado-man-bury-him-in-cement-under-condo.html&description=Karl%20Beaman%20Jr%3a%20Best%20friend%20and%20his%20accomplice%20kill%20Colorado%20man%2c%20bury%20him%20in%20cement%20under%20condo" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./mecole-hayes-net-worth-bio-husband-big-brother.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Mecole Hayes Net Worth Bio, Husband, Big Brother 25, Instagram, Twitter">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./danny-duncan.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Danny Duncan Bio, Age, Height, Girlfriend, Net Worth">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
