It’s possible that Ozark could clinch a surprise win, but when faced between a stalwart drama and a shiny new thing, it seems likely the HFPA will go with the latter.</p><p data-characters=32 data-current-count=32 data-injectable=false><strong>Who we think will win: Severance</strong></p><h3 data-injectable=false><strong>Best Television Series, Musical or Comedy</strong></h3><p data-characters=124 data-current-count=156 data-injectable=false><strong>Nominees:</strong> Abbott Elementary (ABC), The Bear (FX), Hacks (HBO Max), Only Murders in the Building (Hulu), Wednesday (Netflix).</p><p data-characters=405 data-current-count=561 data-injectable=true>This is also a tough one. Will the Globes go with Hacks for a second year in a row, safe picks in either Abbott Elementary or Only Murders in the Building, or with newcomer series Wednesday or The Bear?

On one hand, you’ve got comedy legends Steve Martin and Martin Short. And on the other, there’s Donald Glover, Bill Hader, and Jeremy Allen White, who all gave extremely nuanced dramatic comedy performances. Honestly, you could throw a dart and any of them would be deserving. Will Glover win his third Globe for the fourth and final season of Atlanta, or will Hader win for the first time on his third nomination for Barry?

He also faces stiff competition from Henry Winkler, who was likewise nominated for an Emmy last year. (Both lost to Brett Goldstein for Ted Lasso.) Likewise, both actors gave phenomenal performances in their respective roles, but we feel certain Turturro has got this.</p><p data-characters=36 data-current-count=36 data-injectable=false><strong>Who we think will win: John Turturro</strong></p><h3 data-injectable=false><strong>Best Supporting Actress, Television</strong></h3><p data-characters=161 data-current-count=197 data-injectable=false><strong>Nominees:</strong> Elizabeth Debicki (The Crown), Hannah Einbinder (Hacks), Julia Garner (Ozark), Janelle James (Abbott Elementary), Sheryl Lee Ralph (Abbott Elementary).</p><p data-characters=375 data-current-count=572 data-injectable=true>It seems a little bit unfair to lump comedy and drama together for the best supporting roles, with previous Emmy winners Julia Garner and Sheryl Lee Ralph now going head to head. But it would be cool to see Janelle James get recognized for her side-splitting portrayal as principal Ava Coleman in Abbott Elementary, so we’re just going to put our dreams out into the world.</p><p data-characters=36 data-current-count=36 data-injectable=false><strong>Who we think will win: Janelle James</strong></p><h3 data-injectable=false><strong>Best Limited Series, Anthology Series or a Motion Picture Made for Television</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/the-white-lotus.jpg><p data-characters=144 data-current-count=480 data-injectable=true><strong>Nominees:</strong> Black Bird (Apple TV), Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story (Netflix), The Dropout (Hulu), Pam & Tommy (Hulu), The White Lotus (HBO).</p><p data-characters=396 data-current-count=396 data-injectable=false>Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story may currently stand as Netflix’s second most-viewed English series of all time, but does it deserve to win a Golden Globe? Readers, we think not. Any of the other series nominated in this category would be more deserving — even Hulu’s fun and mostly unserious Pam & Tommy — but The White Lotus will most likely repeat Emmys history to clinch the win.</p><p data-characters=38 data-current-count=434 data-injectable=true><strong>Who we think will win: The White Lotus</strong></p><h3 data-injectable=false><strong>Best Performance by an Actor, Limited Series, Anthology Series or Motion Picture Made for Television</strong></h3><p data-characters=195 data-current-count=195 data-injectable=false><strong>Nominees:</strong> Taron Egerton (Black Bird), Colin Firth (The Staircase), Andrew Garfield (Under the Banner of Heaven), Evan Peters (Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story), Sebastian Stan (Pam & Tommy).</p><p data-characters=300 data-current-count=495 data-injectable=true>This one will probably also come down to the true crime trifecta of Taron Egerton, Colin Firth, and Andrew Garfield — although all five nominees technically fall under the same genre. Does Egerton have another win in him after 2020’s Rocketman? That remains to be seen, but we have a gut feeling.</p><p data-characters=36 data-current-count=36 data-injectable=false><strong>Who we think will win: Taron Egerton</strong></p><h3 data-injectable=false><strong>Best Performance by an Actress, Limited Series, Anthology Series or a Motion Picture Made for Television</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/the-dropout.jpg><p data-characters=162 data-current-count=498 data-injectable=true><strong>Nominees:</strong> Jessica Chastain (George and Tammy), Julia Garner (Inventing Anna), Lily James (Pam & Tommy), Julia Roberts (Gaslit), Amanda Seyfried (The Dropout).</p><p data-characters=364 data-current-count=364 data-injectable=false>Can Julia Roberts in the Starz political thriller Gaslit beat out Amanda Seyfried’s gravely-voiced portrayal of Elizabeth Holmes in Hulu’s The Dropout? It’s going to be a tight race, but we think Seyfriend has the advantage here — given that her performance was so fantastic that she literally caused Jennifer Lawrence to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">abandon her dueling Apple TV film</a>.</p><p data-characters=38 data-current-count=402 data-injectable=true><strong>Who we think will win: Amanda Seyfried</strong></p><h3 data-injectable=false><strong>Best Performance by an Actress in Supporting Role, Limited Series, Anthology Series or a Motion Picture Made for Television</strong></h3><p data-characters=220 data-current-count=220 data-injectable=false><strong>Nominees:</strong> Jennifer Coolidge (The White Lotus), Claire Danes (Fleishman Is in Trouble), Daisy Edgar-Jones (Under the Banner of Heaven), Niecy Nash-Betts (Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story), Aubrey Plaza (The White Lotus).</p><p data-characters=570 data-current-count=790 data-injectable=true>Fans of HBO’s The White Lotus will most certainly be rooting for Jennifer Coolidge and Aubrey Plaza, who are both nominated for the second season of Mike White’s HBO anthology series. And yes, Coolidge’s instantly iconic line of “These gays! They’re trying to murder me!” will not be leaving the pop culture lexicon anytime soon. However, it would be presumptuous to overlook Danes, who gave a raw, heartwrenching performance in the pivotal, penultimate episode of FX’s fantastic Fleishman Is in Trouble, as a woman in the midst of a nervous breakdown.</p><p data-characters=35 data-current-count=35 data-injectable=false><strong>Who we think will win: Claire Danes</strong></p><h3 data-injectable=false><strong>Best Performance by an Actor in Supporting Role, Limited Series, Anthology Series or a Motion Picture Made for Television</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image1-121.jpg><p data-characters=194 data-current-count=529 data-injectable=true><strong>Nominees:</strong> F.
