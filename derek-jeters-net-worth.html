The bulk of the money comes from his 20-year-old career with the New York Yankees of Major League Baseball, and also from various investments in businesses and real estate.</p><p>Derek Jeter who was born on June 26, 1974, in Pequannock, New Jersey, and raised in Kalamazoo, Michigan, started playing baseball in high school before he was offered a baseball scholarship by the University of Michigan. In, 1992, he was selected by the New York Yankees in the 1992 MLB draft who signed him for $800,000 after he went pro.</p><p>Subsequently, Jeter and the Yankees reached an agreement on a $540,000 deal, including bonuses before the start of the 1997 season, and earned $750,000 in the following year. Similarly, his salary grew to $5 million before the beginning of the 1999 campaign and was offered a one-year contract worth $10 million during the 1999-2000 offseason.</p><p>Shortly before the commencement of the 2001 season, the New Jersey-born signed a 10-year $189 million contract. The deal made Jeter the second-highest-paid-athlete in all team sports and auto racing, and his $18.9 million annual salary is the third highest in baseball.</p><p>At the expiration of his contract, he signed another three-year $50 million deal with an option for an additional one-year option at the end of the 2010 season. By 2014, he re-signed a one-year deal worth $12 million.</p><p>At the end of his baseball career in 2014, celebritynetworth.com and wealthygorilla.com indicated that Derek Jetter earned $265 million in salary alone.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_New_Jersey-Born_Also_Earned_Millions_Of_Dollars_From_His_Lucrative_Endorsements></span><strong>The New Jersey-Born Also Earned Millions Of Dollars From His Lucrative Endorsements</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Outside baseball, endorsement deals also contributed significantly to Derek Jeter’s net worth.

He was said to have invested $25 million for a 4 percent share in the team. In 2022 after five years, he sold his 4 percent stake for $44.8 million.</p><p>In the 3rd quarter of 2022, Jeter alongside Brian Lee,&nbsp; and Jesse Glass, partnered and launched <a href=# rel=noopener>Arena Club</a>, a card grading and selling firm.</p><p>Sometime in 2013, he partnered with Simon & Schuster to start a publishing outfit called <a href=# rel=noopener>Jeter Publishing</a>.

So far, they have published several books such as&nbsp;JETER Unfiltered, Seeing Home: The Ed Lucas Story, and Born Just Bright&nbsp;By Jordan Reeves & Jen&nbsp; Lee Reeves.</p><p>He also founded a website called theplayerstribune.com&nbsp;in October 2014 which provides content on basketball, football, soccer, hockey, and baseball.

He has invested millions of dollars into buying luxury mansions. Starting in 2001, he paid $12.6 million for a penthouse in Trump World Tower in Manhattan, listed the apartment in 2010 for $20 million, and sold it in October at $15.5 million.&nbsp; In 2003, <a href=# rel=noopener>he bought a 4-acre property</a> in Greenwood, New York at $425,000 in 2003, and put it on the market in 2018 for $14.75 million after major renovations.
