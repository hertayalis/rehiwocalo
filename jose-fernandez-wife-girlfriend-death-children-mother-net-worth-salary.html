As a teenager, he emigrated with his mother to the United States where he attended Braulio Alonso High School in Tampa, Florida.&nbsp;He started playing baseball in his high school with great energy and talent, which made him stand out on his team.&nbsp;The vibrant teenager retained a Florida State Champion Grade 6A position in his second and third seasons.</span></p><p><span>In 2011, he started his Minor League Baseball(MLB) when the Florida Marlins selected him in the 2011 MLB Draft. He then made a start for the league’s Gulf Coast Marlins Rookie-level Gulf Coast and another start for the New York-Penn Class A-Short League Jamestown Jammers.&nbsp;The young pitcher started the 2012 baseball season by defeating the South Atlantic League (SAL) Class A Greensboro Grasshoppers, where he won SAL Pitcher of the Week twice.&nbsp;He made his Major League Baseball debut in April 2013 against the New York Mets, where he broke the record for 7th under-21 pitcher with at least 8 strikeouts since 1916.</span></p><p><span>Later in 2013, he also played for the National League All-Star MiamiMarlins where he rose to prominence as one of 3 under-21 pitchers for their all-star debut., who knocked out two batters.&nbsp;The pitcher was nicknamed ‘Nino’ ​​by his teammates due to the way he played with such vigor and skill.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Jose Fernandez wife, girlfriend, children</span></strong></h2><p><span>The Miami Marlins pitcher was married at age 20 to Alejandra Baleato Marichal in December 2012 in Tampa, Florida.&nbsp;The two were known to be lovebirds in high school, but their marriage lasted just over a year.</span></p><p><span>Fernandez started dating Maria Arias after her divorce.&nbsp;The two men met at the cinema and became a couple shortly after.&nbsp;Maria quickly got pregnant for the pitcher 5 months into the relationship and in February 2017 she had a gorgeous daughter, Penelope Jo Fernandez.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Mother</span></strong></h2><p><span>Pitcher Maimi Marlin’s mother is MaritzaFernandez.&nbsp;She had a close bond with her son and was devastated by the news of his passing.&nbsp;She and her young son had tried to avoid Cuba about four times in search of greener pastures in the United States.&nbsp;She recalled in one of their diaries that it was José who risked his life to save her when she fell overboard while heading to the United States from Cuba.</span></p><p><span>The news of her son’s death came as a blow as she revealed in an interview with People’s magazine.&nbsp;It was a horrible experience for her and it is still like a dream that she wishes she would wake up from one day.&nbsp;The grieving mother also refuted and dismissed any evidence that her son had used cocaine or was under the influence of alcohol during his death.&nbsp;She claimed he was an exceptional player who played drug-free.</span></p><p><span>Maritza said her heart melted at the funeral when she saw the large crowd that had come to pay their respects to her son, saying she had no idea he was loved to that extent.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Jose Fernandez Salary, Net Worth</span></strong></h2><p><span>As a talented player, Jose Fernandez’s salary was around $651,000 per year.&nbsp;He was also entitled to annual allowances worth $6,200.&nbsp;At the time of his death, it was reported that he had earned over $6 million.&nbsp;He is said to have a current net worth of around $2.8 million.</span></p><p><span>His mother Maritza and his girlfriend Maria Arias were placed in charge of his assets upon his death.</span></p><h2><strong><span>The death of José Fernandez</span></strong></h2><p><span>The baseball star met his untimely death via a boat accident on Maimi Beach in September 2016. Two other people also died in the fiasco, Eduardo Rivero and Emilio Jesus Macias.&nbsp;The boat reportedly hit a mass of rocks and the impact killed the three men.</span></p><p><span>The autopsy results, however, revealed that Jose Fernandez overdosed on cocaine and had too much alcohol while driving the boat.&nbsp;His family, however, do not believe the report that he takes such harsh drugs or has alcohol problems.</span></p><p><span>The families of the other two men lost in the February 2017 crash have filed a lawsuit against Jose’s estate worth $2 million each for the loss of their children due to the pitcher’s negligence.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGiin6iybrLEq6WappSax27DyJ%2BcZp%2BZp7mnvsiepZ1llJqutbSMnJ%2BipJSnsq95zKiroZ2iYrumwIywpqusmGLAorjAq7Bo</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fjose-fernandez-wife-girlfriend-death-children-mother-net-worth-salary.html&text=Jose%20Fernandez%20Wife%2c%20Girlfriend%2c%20Death%2c%20Children%2c%20Mother%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Salary&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjose-fernandez-wife-girlfriend-death-children-mother-net-worth-salary.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjose-fernandez-wife-girlfriend-death-children-mother-net-worth-salary.html&title=Jose%20Fernandez%20Wife%2c%20Girlfriend%2c%20Death%2c%20Children%2c%20Mother%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Salary" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fjose-fernandez-wife-girlfriend-death-children-mother-net-worth-salary.html&title=Jose%20Fernandez%20Wife%2c%20Girlfriend%2c%20Death%2c%20Children%2c%20Mother%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Salary" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fjose-fernandez-wife-girlfriend-death-children-mother-net-worth-salary.html&title=Jose%20Fernandez%20Wife%2c%20Girlfriend%2c%20Death%2c%20Children%2c%20Mother%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Salary" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjose-fernandez-wife-girlfriend-death-children-mother-net-worth-salary.html&description=Jose%20Fernandez%20Wife%2c%20Girlfriend%2c%20Death%2c%20Children%2c%20Mother%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Salary" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./lisa-rinna-leaves-little-to-the-imagination-in-nsfw-message-of-self-love.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Lisa Rinna Leaves Little to the Imagination in NSFW Post of Self-Love">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./butternut-squash-kale-quinoa-stew.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Butternut Squash, Kale &amp;amp; Quinoa Stew">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
